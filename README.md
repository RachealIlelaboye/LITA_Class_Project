### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
At the phase of data cleaning and preprocessing, the following actions were performed:
- Removing Duplicates: Identification and removal of duplicate entries from datasets, ensuring data integrity.
- Handling Missing Values: Rows with missing data were removed.
- Data Validation: Data validation rules were set to ensure accurate data entry, such as limiting inputs to specific types, ranges, or predefined lists.
- Data Loading
- Data Formatting

### Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive Statistics: Use of functions (e.g., AVERAGE(), Sum(), STDEV(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()) provide key statistical summaries to understand central tendencies and data variability.

### Data Visualization
- Conditional Formatting
- Dashboards: Excel was used to build interactive dashboards that present key metrics and -data visualizations, offering a clear snapshot of business performance.
- Data Summarization: Pivot tables allow users to dynamically summarize large datasets, grouping data based on categories or time periods to quickly derive insights.
- Customization: Pivot tables can be easily customized with filters, slicers, and calculated fields to answer specific questions or explore different perspectives.
- Pivot Charts: Coupled with pivot tables, pivot charts visually represent summarized data, making it easier to understand relationships and trends.

## SQL
---
### Creating and Modifying Data Models
- Table Creation: SQL was used to create new tables in a database to store specific datasets for analysis or reporting.
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Employee (
staf`fid varchar (10) not null,
FirstName varchar (255) NOT NULL,
SecondName varchar (255),
Gender varchar (10),
Date_of_Birth date,
HireDate datetime,
primary key (staffid))
```
- Inserting Data: 
```SQL
insert into Employee (staffid, firstname, secondname, gender,Date_of_Birth, hiredate)
values ( 'AB401', 'ayan', 'olakun', 'female', '1992-08-22', '2018-02-09'),
( 'AB212', 'okorie', 'mercy', 'female','1988-10-09', '2018-10-09'),
( 'AB223', 'joshua', 'chukwuemeka', 'male','1980-10-09', '2022-02-09'),
( 'AB234', 'sanni', 'ibrahim', 'male','1958-10-09', '2019-09-23'),
( 'AB254', 'mercy', 'olanipekun', 'female','1982-10-09', '2020-02-09'),
( 'AB249', 'johnson', 'mercy', 'female','1982-10-09', '2019-12-09'),
( 'AB298', 'ayomide', 'halleluyah', 'female', '1982-10-09','2018-07-11'),
( 'AB260', 'deborah', 'justin', 'female','1982-10-09', '2018-02-09'),
( 'AB281', 'wale', 'olanipekun', 'male','1982-10-09', '2018-02-09')
```

- Updating Data: To update existing records, which is useful for correcting data errors or making adjustments.
```SQL
insert into [dbo].[Employee]
values ( 'AB200', 'ayomide', 'halleluyah', 'female', '1982-10-09','2018-07-11')
```
- Deleting Data: To delete irrelevant or outdated data.
```SQL
 delete from employee
where staffid  = 'ab281'
```
### Data Retrieval (Querying Data)
- Selecting Data: To retrieve specific data from large datasets using the SELECT statement. You can pull exactly the data needed from one or multiple tables based on specific criteria.
```SQL
select * from Employee;
```
- Filtering Data: Using the WHERE clause, to filter data based on specific conditions, making it easy to extract subsets of data that meet certain criteria.
```SQL
 SELECT * FROM Salary
WHERE Staffid = 'AB281';
```
- Sorting Data: SQL allows sorting of results in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY sale_amount DESC;
```
### Data Aggregation and Summarization
- Aggregating Data: Aggregation functions such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX() were used to summarize and analyze data.
```SQL
 SELECT AVG(salary) AS AVERAGESALARY FROM Salary
```
- Group By Function: The GROUP BY clause was used to group rows that have the same values in specific columns and then apply aggregate functions to each group.
```SQL
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```
- HAVING Clause: This clause allows filtering on aggregated data (after applying the GROUP BY clause).
```SQL
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```
### Data Filtering and Conditional Logic
- Using Logical Operators: SQLâ€™s logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT for advanced filtering of data.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100 AND category = 'Electronics';
```
- Joining Data from Multiple Tables
  - Inner Join: INNER JOIN retrieves only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
```SQL
select employee.staffid, employee.firstname, employee.gender,employee.hiredate,employee.state_of_origin,Salary.department, Salary.salary, Payment.Account_No, Payment.Bank, Payment.Payment_Method
from employee
inner join Salary
on salary.Staffid = employee.staffid
inner join Payment
on Payment.staffid = salary.Staffid
```
   - Left Join: A LEFT JOIN retrieves all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table, returning NULL for missing matches.
```SQL
select employee.staffid, employee.firstname, employee.gender,employee.hiredate,employee.state_of_origin, Salary.department,Salary.salary
     from employee
     left join Salary
     on salary.Staffid = employee.staffid
```

### Data Integrity and Quality Checks
- Identifying Duplicates: SQL can easily identify and remove duplicates using the DISTINCT keyword or by finding duplicate entries based on specific columns.
```SQL
 SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders;
```
- Checking for Missing Data: SQL can be used to detect missing or incomplete data using IS NULL or IS NOT NULL conditions.
```SQL
 SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email IS NULL;
```
- Data Validation: Ensuring data quality through validation checks such as  (UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK) to the dataset.
